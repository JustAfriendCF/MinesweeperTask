# MinesweeperTask

Hello, I am Michal, I am a UAI. mentor and dev
I specialize in Unreal Engine Blueprints and C++
This task required C++ and Slate skills
As I have not used Slate before, I decided to approach this task in three steps:
1) I created the Minesweeper game in C++.
2) I learned the basic principles of Slate and created the widget.
3) I created an Editor Tool plugin and moved the code there.
Slate was actually pretty easy to learn, as it felt similar to how I used to create things in HTML.
I used WindSurf in VS as an autocompletion and ChatGPT to fix bugs.

It was a cool challenge. ðŸ¤—
